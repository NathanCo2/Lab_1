Lab 1

The goal of this lab is to create a Motor Driver class that can be used to set up and drive
a motor. By passing in the correct pins on the Nucleo board with a IHM04A1 motor driver attached
atop, we can define our enable/disable pin and pwm pin outputs. The motors can be run in each 
direction and stopped.
